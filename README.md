# Penicillin Fermentation Process Modeling with Genetic Algorithm and Deep Learning

This project uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize hyperparameters for deep learning models (LSTM, CNN, Transformer, Regression) to predict key outcomes of the Penicillin fermentation process. The best-performing model is then trained and evaluated using RMSE and ensemble learning.
